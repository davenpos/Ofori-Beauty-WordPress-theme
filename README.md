# Ofori Beauty theme

This is a custom WordPress site that I built for Ofori Beauty--a beauty supply and services company--in 2023 as part of Riipen's Level Up program.

I created a brand new classic WordPress theme from scratch and designed it to look like the actual Ofori Beauty website at the time. I also added some new features to it, including a blog section, a 404 page, and a live search powered by JavaScript and the WordPress Rest API. Additionally, the theme also utilizes WooCommerce for buying services from the site (although I did not finish setting up WooCommerce since I wasn't going to be the one receiving the money from it), SCSS and jQuery instead of vanilla CSS and JavaScript, Font Awesome for icons and mobile-first responsive design. I also included a traditional fallback search for any browsers with JavaScript disabled and even included support for a custom color picker so that the colors of the site can be changed in the admin dashboard.

From start to finish, it took about a month to finish. I was required to log my time on Riipen and pass the threshold of 80 total hours of work on it, which I did manage to achieve. I ended up getting paid $1400 for the project.
